# TestDrive-Ember
> The TestDrive sample application provides you with a near blank template to get started with. It is great for learning and trying Kinvey, or to build your first application upon.

## Run It
After downloading or cloning the repository:

* Replace `App Key` and `App Secret` (`js/application.js`) with your application credentials.
* Start a web server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`.
* Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000`. Adjust the hostname and port number if necessary.

## Functionality
The application demonstrates:

* Basic set-up for Ember.js apps using Kinvey.
* Basic sign-up and logout functionality.
* Pinging the Kinvey service.

## Architecture
The app follows the Ember.js guidelines on how to structure your app. Please follow the [Ember.js Getting Started guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/getting-started/) to learn more.
